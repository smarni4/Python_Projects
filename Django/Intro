########### Django #############

* Django is a Python backend web development framework.
* offers built-in solutions and features for basically all problems. Customizable and extensible.
* build production-ready websites.

########### Installation and creating a project folder #########

* To install Django run the command " pip3 install Django "
* To start a project run the command in the desired folder "django-admin startproject {project_name} "
* The above command will create manage.py and other required python files inside the sub-folder where you ran the above command.
* To write and implement the python code we need to install a Integrated Development Tool such as Pycharm, Visual Studio Code. For this project I am using Pycharm.
* Install an extension named Pylance which is a language server for Python.
