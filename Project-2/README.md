# Home Inventory Application Framework

Implements a reference application you can use for inspiration. 

The application displays a sample menu from which users make a selection. The application processes user's menu choice and calls a corresponding method, which is stubbed out, or exits the application when the user enters 7 by setting the `self.keep_going` to `False`.

## General Instructions

**NOTE:** If you're running Windows, you'll need to edit the `build.sh` script, locate the `runmain()` method and change `python3` to `python`.
